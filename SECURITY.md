## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, email me privately with what OS the vulnerablity is on, how it works, any logs, how you can reproduce it and other important details. You'll get a response within a week or two explaining whether or not it was added to the latest release. Please **do not** report a vulnerablity in the issues tab or make it public.
