# Fours

## About
Fours is an open-source 'ever-growing maths library' coded and maintained by [ctrl-shift-markus](https://www.github.com/ctrl-shift-markus). Originally meant to be a CLI tool for solving standard form quadratic equations, Fours has evolved into a maths library (with quadratic equation functions). The name (when it used to be a CLI tool for solving standard form quadratic equations) was based on '**quad**ratic' having '**quad**' in the word - which means four - but as a maths library, the name can refer to there being **four** basic arithmetic operations. Fours is programmed and designed for C# only.
